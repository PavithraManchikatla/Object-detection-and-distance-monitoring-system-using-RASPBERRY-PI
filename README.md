This project involves creating a real-time object detection and distance 
monitoring system using Raspberry Pi.This system integrates a camera,an 
ultrasonic sensor,and a servo motor to monitor the environment,detect 
objects,measure their distances,and store the data in an SQLite database.The 
Flask web framework is used to serve a live video feed and display distance data 
on a web server. 
The project basically targeted to detect objects and distance of object at the 
boundary of country to avoid threats and react immediately.This application will 
live stream the camera to check it out whenever required. This works only when 
raspberry pi and computer are connected to same network. This project aims to 
develop an advanced monitoring and control system that integrates ultrasonic 
distance measurement, servo motor control, and real-time video streaming with 
object detection. Leveraging a combination of these technologies, the system 
provides a comprehensive solution for real-time environmental monitoring and 
automation. 
At its core, the system uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure distances and 
detect the presence of nearby objects. This data is then used to control a servo 
motor, enabling automated responses based on distance measurements. A real- 
time video feed is streamed through a web interface, allowing users to monitor 
their environment and view detected objects directly from their devices.
